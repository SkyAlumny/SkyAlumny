 **My Start as Developer**
I played a lot of Video Games as a Kid and my Dream was to one Day create my own. My 11 Years Old self started to watch Tutorial Videos with the Godot Engine and worked with it for half a Year. At that Time i didn't have my own PC and used the one from my Mother but she didn't know about that. Then I gave up but on a random Day i thought about how it would be like to Create my own Website, and I started watching Videos about HTML on my Phone and coded it with my Phone. I already gave up after 1 Day since it is hard to work with a Phone. I met someone Online. We were Friends for 1 year and he made a Discord Bot, i wondered how he made it and showed me an App on the Phone to Create Bots. At this time I was already older and understood good English. The App made it possible to write a Discord Bot with his own Easy Language that is similar to Javascript. This Friend helped me to get my own Good PC that i have until Today! At The Time i got my PC... Everything started. I learned Python Discord Bot coding from a German small Youtuber that made great Videos. I must say Python is nothing for me and i switched Really fast to Javascript. I learned how to create Websites and started with Unity to learn how to make 2D Games. I worked with the Engine for over 3 Years and made awesome things. I must say that I really didn't do much for School at this Time since I want to learn Coding very fast and well. I started with Game modding someday for Fortnite and made some cool modding stuff that made me familiar with a lot of new things. I used Unity for very long and i realized that Unity is very bad for Big Complex Games and already known about Unreal Engine, so i switched to UE4 and watched some Tutorial Videos which where very bad and make a false view to Unreal Engine for me, so i got back on Unity and since it got boring i stopped Game Developing. I don't really know what I did after very small Projects. I made 2 verified Discord Bots, 1 Discord Bot list and 300+ added Bots. Some Day i got back to Unreal Engine and got used to it, and today i'm still creating a Game with it. There are a lot of small Projects that I made (FiveM, Minecraft, Modding and more) I can't even remember since I had like 20 Projects at the same time running. Today the latest moment my Projects are Cheats for Games and Hardware things, i made some App and Software stuff before too and made useful very Complex Applications for Desktop. Well I still hope i will create many more Projects in the Future and Release one Day my Final Game i dreamed of as a Kid. Off Course I still want to expand my Skill Tree and see what the Feature has with it.
