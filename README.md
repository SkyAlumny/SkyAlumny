 **My Start as Developer**
 I played a lot off Video Games as a Kid and my Deam was to create one Day my own. My 11 Years Old self started to watch Tutorial Videos with the Godot Engine and worked with it a half Year. To that Time i didnt had my own PC and used the one from my Mother but she didnt know about that. Then i gave up but at a random Day i tought about how could it would be like to Create his own Website, and i started watching Videos about HTML on my Phone and coded it with my Phone, i alreafy gave up after 1 Day since it is hard to work with a Phone. I meat someone Online, we where Friends for 1 year and he made a Discord Bot, i wondered how he made it and showed my a App on the Phone to Create Bots, at this time i was already older and understand good English. The App made it possible to write a Discord Bot with his own Easy Language that is smilar to Javascript. This Friend helped me to get my own Good PC that i have until Today! At The Time i got my PC... Everything started. I learned Python Discord Bot coding from a German small Youtuber that made great Videos. I must say Python is nothing for me and i switched Really fast to Javascript. I learned how to create Websites and started with Unity to learn how to make 2D Games. I worked with the Engine over 3 Years and made owseome things. I must say that i really didnt made much for School at this Time since i want to learn Coding very fast and good. I started with Game modding someday for Fortnite and made some cool modding stuff that made me familier with a lot off new things. I used Unity for very long and i realised that Unity is very bad for Big Complex Games and already knowed about Unreal Engine, so i switched to UE4 and watched some Tutorial Videos which where very bad and make a false view to Unreal Engine for me, so i got back on Unity and since it got boring i stoped Game Developing. I dont really know what i did after, very much small Projects. I made 2 verified Discord Bots, 1 Discord Bot list and 300+ added Bots. Some Day i got back to Unreal Engine and got used to it, and today iam still creating a Game with it. There is a lot off small Projects that i made (FiveM, Minecraft, Modding and more) i cant even remember since i had like 20 Projects at the same time running. Today the latest moment my Projects are Cheats for Games and Hardware things, i made some App and Sofrware stuff before too and made useful very Complex Applications for Desktop. Well i still hope i will create much more Projects at the Future and Realese one Day my Final Game i dreamed off as a Kid. Off Course i still want to expend my Skill Tree and see what the Feature has with it.
